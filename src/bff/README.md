# BFF (Back-end for Front-end)

Here is the BFF module, which served as an APIs management and integration service. All sub-modules of BFF are powered by KOA, a NodeJS framework, which has high efficiency during high concurrency requests and is easy to expand.

All BFF sub-modules are able to request micro-services, integrate response, and response to front-end by HTTP protocol. BFF have their integrated APIs, which primarily respond to front-end websites.
